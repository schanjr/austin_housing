## House Rules & Code Style
- No inline comments or documentation unless the code is very complex.
- If code is very complex, simplify and break it down (Keep it DRY).
- Do not add unnecessary new lines with empty spaces.
- Use Poetry 2 for dependency management.
- Use best practices in terms of python coding, file setup, conventions, and framework specific conventions.
- Main frameworks/libraries: pandas, geopandas, matplotlib, plotly, pydeck, streamlit, requests, beautifulsoup4, numpy.
- **Current Implementation**: PyDeck-powered interactive dashboard with clickable property markers
- **No Synthetic Data Policy**: 100% real data sources, zero fake or randomly generated data

## Important runtime related information: 
1. When executing any python commands, use this runtime: /Users/schan/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/austin-housing-x_D9OdhG-py3.12/bin/python
2. When executing any poetry commands, use this shim /Users/schan/.pyenv/shims/poetry
3. When adding or removing dependencies, use poetry commands instead of editing pyproject.toml directly.

## MD files updating
1. When working through the projects, if any of the md file is outdated or have misinformation, go ahead edit them and improve the md files based on the latest information you have.
