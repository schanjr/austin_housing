# Austin Housing Analysis: Data Sources and Methodology

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the data sources used in the Austin rental analysis project, how they are processed, and how they contribute to our livability calculations.

## üö® NO FAKE DATA POLICY

**The Austin Housing Dashboard project operates under a strict NO FAKE DATA POLICY:**

- ‚úÖ **Real data only** - All sources must be legitimate (Redfin, Austin Open Data, crime databases, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Single CSV output** - No duplicate JSON/CSV pairs to avoid redundancy
- ‚ùå **No synthetic generation** - No random data creation anywhere in the codebase
- ‚ùå **No fake listings** - All property data comes from real rental websites

**Policy Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** (as of 2025-09-21)

## Current Data Pipeline Architecture

### Master Dataset Generation
The project uses a **single master dataset** approach:
- **Input**: Multiple real data sources (scraped listings, geocoded coordinates, crime data, SAFMR)
- **Processing**: `generate_master_data.py` merges all sources with calculated scores
- **Output**: Single `master_properties.csv` file (15,666+ real properties)
- **Dashboard**: Loads exclusively from master dataset for optimal performance

### Data File Structure (CSV Only)
```

## Real Data Collection and Scraping

### Available Scraper Commands (Real Data Only)

```bash
# Scrape real Redfin listings (ACTIVE)
poetry run scrape-redfin

# Note: Zillow scraper disabled due to 403 blocking
# poetry run scrape-zillow  # ‚ùå DISABLED

# Geocode property addresses to precise coordinates  
poetry run geocode-all

# Generate master dataset with all real data sources
poetry run generate-data

# Run dashboard with real data
poetry run dashboard
```

### Scraper Features and Architecture

#### Real Data Collection Process
1. **ZIP Code Discovery**: Scrapers automatically discover Austin ZIP codes from SAFMR data
2. **Systematic Scraping**: Each ZIP code is scraped with rate limiting and error handling
3. **Progress Tracking**: Partial results saved every 10 ZIP codes to prevent data loss
4. **Resume Capability**: Can resume from interruptions without losing progress

#### Data Output (CSV Only)
Scrapers generate **single CSV files only** in `data/processed/`:
- `redfin_listings_complete.csv` - Real Redfin rental listings (15,666+ properties)
- `geocoded_listings_progress.csv` - Precise property coordinates
- `master_properties.csv` - Merged dataset with all real data sources

**No JSON Files**: All JSON output removed to enforce single-file policy and eliminate redundancy.

#### Scraper Status
- ‚úÖ **Redfin Scraper**: Active - collecting real rental listings with ZIP-code based scraping
- ‚úÖ **Geocoding**: Active - converting addresses to precise coordinates using OpenStreetMap
- ‚úÖ **Master Dataset**: Active - single authoritative CSV with all merged real data
- ‚ùå **Zillow Scraper**: Disabled due to anti-bot blocking (403 errors)

#### Error Handling and Monitoring
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays between requests (2-6 seconds)
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for failed requests
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues scraping other ZIP codes if one fails
- **Progress Preservation**: Incremental saves prevent data loss
- **Comprehensive Logging**: INFO, DEBUG, ERROR, and WARNING levels

### 2. Data Processing Steps

1. **Real Rental Data Scraping:**
   - Scrapes live listings from Redfin.com
   - Extracts real addresses, prices, property details
   - Saves to single CSV file (no JSON duplicates)
   - Rate-limited and resumable scraping

2. **Property Geocoding:**
   - Converts real addresses to precise coordinates
   - Uses OpenStreetMap Nominatim API (free)
   - Multi-threaded processing for performance
   - Incremental progress saving with resume capability

3. **Master Dataset Generation:**
   - Merges all real data sources into single CSV
   - Calculates property scores using real data
   - Prioritizes CSV data over any legacy JSON
   - Creates authoritative dataset for dashboard

4. **Dashboard Data Loading:**
   - Loads exclusively from master CSV dataset
   - No synthetic data generation anywhere
   - Real-time filtering and analysis
   - Performance optimized for 15,000+ properties

### 2. Data Processing and Integration

1. **Spatial Joining:**
   - Convert geocoded ZIP codes to a GeoDataFrame with point geometries
   - Perform a spatial join with council district boundaries
   - Result: Each ZIP code is associated with its containing council district

2. **Crime Score Calculation:**
   - Normalize crime incidents by council district
   - Calculate a safety score where higher values indicate safer areas
   - Formula: `crime_score = 1 - ((incidents - min_incidents) / (max_incidents - min_incidents))`

3. **Affordability Filtering:**
   - For each ZIP code, check which unit sizes (studio, 1BR, 2BR, etc.) have rents under $1,500
   - Create boolean indicators for affordability of each unit type
   - Calculate an overall affordability score based on the proportion of affordable unit types

### 3. Livability Index Calculation

The livability index is a weighted composite score calculated as follows:

1. **Base Components:**
   - Affordability Score: Proportion of unit types under $1,500 (30% weight)
   - Safety Score: Normalized crime rate by district (25% weight)
   - Accessibility: Currently not implemented (20% weight placeholder)
   - Neighborhood Quality: Currently not implemented (15% weight placeholder)
   - Environmental Risk: Currently not implemented (10% weight placeholder)

2. **Formula:**
   ```
   livability_score = (0.3 * affordability_score + 0.25 * safety_score) * 100
   ```

3. **Interpretation:**
   - Higher scores indicate more livable areas based on our criteria
   - Maximum possible score is 100
   - Current implementation includes only affordability and safety components

## Data Sources Not Yet Implemented

### 1. Walkability and Transit Scores

**What it would provide:** Metrics for pedestrian-friendliness and public transit access by location.

**Potential source:** WalkScore API

**How it would enhance analysis:** Would contribute to the accessibility and neighborhood quality components of the livability index.

### 2. School Ratings

**What it would provide:** Educational quality metrics by school district or attendance zone.

**Potential source:** GreatSchools API

**How it would enhance analysis:** Would contribute to the neighborhood quality component of the livability index, especially important for families with children.

### 3. Environmental Risk Data

**What it would provide:** Information about flood zones, wildfire risk, and other environmental hazards.

**Potential sources:** FEMA Flood Map Service Center, NOAA hazard datasets

**How it would enhance analysis:** Would populate the currently empty environmental risk component of the livability index.

### 4. Amenities and Points of Interest

**What it would provide:** Proximity to grocery stores, hospitals, parks, and other amenities.

**Potential sources:** Google Places API, OpenStreetMap

**How it would enhance analysis:** Would contribute to the accessibility and neighborhood quality components of the livability index.

## Data Limitations and Considerations

1. **Temporal Relevance:** Crime data is from 2024, while SAFMR data is for FY 2025. This temporal mismatch should be considered when interpreting results.

2. **Spatial Aggregation:** Crime data is aggregated at the council district level, which is coarser than ZIP codes. This means all ZIP codes within the same district receive the same safety score.

3. **Missing Components:** The current livability index only implements two of the five planned components (affordability and safety). The remaining components (accessibility, neighborhood quality, and environmental risk) are placeholders with weights but no actual data.

4. **Data Access Issues:** Some APIs (particularly on data.austintexas.gov) may return HTTP 403 errors when accessed programmatically. Using API tokens or browser-based downloads may be necessary in some cases.
