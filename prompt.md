## Suggested Libraries
- Data Wrangling: pandas, geopandas
- Visualization: matplotlib, plotly, folium (for maps)
- APIs & Requests: requests, googlemaps, walkscore
- Streamlit: for building the interactive dashboard

## Project Setup
- Use Poetry 2 for dependency management
- Adhere to the code style rules outlined in "House Rules & Code Style".
- Organize repository into:
  - data/ → raw & processed datasets
  - notebooks/ → exploratory analysis
  - src/ → data pipelines & analysis scripts
  - app/ → Streamlit dashboard
  - PROMPT.md → project brain

## Expert Strategy

As the “AI Real Estate Analyst,” the path to answering “Where is the best place to rent in Austin?” involves:
1. Data Acquisition  
  Collect raw datasets for rentals, crime, commute, amenities, and environmental risks.
2. Feature Engineering  
  Normalize each dataset to the neighborhood or census tract level. Build features such as:
  - Crime incidents per 1,000 residents
  - Commute time by car/transit to downtown
  - Flood risk indicator
  - Rent per square foot
  - Walkability/transit score
3. Scoring Framework  
  Create a composite livability index using weighted parameters. Example:
  - 30% affordability
  - 25% safety
  - 20% commute & accessibility
  - 15% neighborhood quality
  - 10% environmental risk
  - (Weights adjustable in the dashboard)
4. Analysis  
  Rank neighborhoods based on this composite score under the rent cap.
5. Visualization  
  - Interactive map of Austin neighborhoods (colored by livability index)
  - Filter by rent budget, number of bedrooms, commute tolerance, etc.

## Future Extensions
- Incorporate real-time rental listings via APIs or scraping
- Forecast rent trends using time series models
- Include user personalization (e.g., weigh school quality higher if user has children)
- Compare Austin against other Texas cities for context
